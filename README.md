# RADS - Reccomendations using Anomoly Detection Systems
Just the first name that came to mind, can be changed later
## Inspiration
Modern day recommendation systems do not focus enough on exploring changing user tastes. To combat that we created this system to give extra emphasis to anomalies in a users listening habits and focus more on metrics such as novelty and serendipity instead of soley on accuracy.

## Dataset
We are using a subset of the [Million Song Dataset]() that only contains 10,000 songs chosen at random from the entire dataset. However, the data is stored in the same format as the entire dataset meaning this approach can be generalized with no changes to the entire dataset.
